## 🌈 Chromythos

***“The myth of light and color creates worlds.”***

**Chromythos** is a creative game development organization where mythology, emotion, and science converge through light and color.
We explore how stories can emerge not from words, but from spectrums — how existence itself can be defined by what we see, feel, and create.

Our worlds are experiments of convergence:
where art becomes system,
where color becomes language,
and where creation itself becomes playable.

Every project under Chromythos is an attempt to unify design, engineering, and narrative into a single continuum of expression.
We believe that light is not just illumination, but the origin of myth —
and color is the code through which worlds are written.

> We do not merely build games — we compose universes where light remembers its own story.
